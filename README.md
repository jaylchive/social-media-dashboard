## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I tried using `figure` element in HTML, but not sure whether I did it right. This challenge was mostly about CSS Grid so I went for almost all of the main biggest layouts. For the Overview section, `grid-template-areas` was so helpful to customize grid item's location.

### Continued development

Will try to look for more `figure` usecases and learn about them more.
